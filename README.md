# TBA (a Transcription factor Binding Analysis)

## TBA Overview
TBA is a multi-functional machine learning tool for identifying transcription factors associated with genomic features. Specifically, TBA can be applied to:
* ChIP-seq targeting a transcription to identify collaborative binding partners for a given transcription factor. 
* DNAse-seq and ATAC-seq to identify transcription factors associated with open chromatin
* GRO-seq and other assays measuring enhancer activity to identify transcription factors associated with enhancer activty
* Predict the effect of genetic variation in any of the above contexts.

## TBA Algorithm
TBA takes the genomic sequence of sites of interest as input and selects a set of GC-matched background loci. For each locus of interest and background locus, TBA calculates the best match to hundreds of DNA binding motifs, and quantifies the quality of the match as the motif score (aka log likelihood ratio score). To allow for degenerate motifs, all motif matches scoring over zero are considered. The motif scores are then used to train the TBA model to distinguish loci of interest from background loci. TBA scores the probability of observing binding at a sequence by computing a weighted sum over all the motif scores for that sequence. The weight for each motif is learned by iteratively modifying the weights until the modelâ€™s ability to differentiate binding sites from background loci no longer improves. The final motif weight measures whether the presence of a motif is correlated with TF binding. 

## Motif Library
TBA uses a programatically curated library of motifs to reduce the effects of multiple collinearity, which can be problematic for machine learning models. You can view and download the motifs at: homer.ucsd.edu/jtao/merged_motifs/allList.html](http://homer.ucsd.edu/jtao/merged_motifs/allList.html "Motif Library")

## Installing TBA
Content coming soon - please refer to our BioRxiv manuscript for now.

## Usage
TBA is accessible as a series of command line (aka termina) scripts. The easiest way to train a TBA model is to use the train_model_default.sh command. train_model_default.sh will run all TBA commands necessary to train a TBA with default parameters. You can invoke the command like this:
```bash
train_model_default.sh mouse_pu1_peaks.bed mm10 path_to_output 
```
The script will create a script at path_to_output/run.sh and execute it. run.sh will have correctly formatted TBA commands for each step. Output files will be created at path_to_output
